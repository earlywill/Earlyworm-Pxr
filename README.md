# Earlyworm-Pxr

Plugin(s?) for Pixar's RenderMan.

Provided largely as-is for the moment.

## Install

If you don't want to compile yourself.

1. Copy the plugin (dll/so) to a plugin location that RenderMan knows about.
2. Copy the args files (arg) to the args sub-directory within that location.
3. Done.

## Compiling

### Windows

1. Open x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017
2. Run following two lines. 
   - `cl -MD /EHsc /D "WIN32" /D "_WINDLL" /I"%RMANTREE%\include" -c %PLUGIN_NAME%.cpp`
   - `link  /DLL /out:%PLUGIN_NAME%.dll %PLUGIN_NAME%.obj "%RMANTREE%\lib\libprman.lib" "%RMANTREE%\lib\libpxrcore.lib"`

3. Follow install instructions above for copying to the right location.

## RIB

RIB files are provided to test out the plugin works. For the RIB to work you'll need to modify the following line to the location where you installed the plugin. 

On Linux/Mac. If you've installed your plugin in a folder called /scenes/rman/custom/plugins then the search path should look like this.

`Option "searchpath" "string rixplugin" ["/scenes/rman/custom/plugins:@"]`

On Windows. If you've installed your plugin in a folder called D:/scenes/rman/custom/plugins then the search path should look like this.

`Option "searchpath" "string rixplugin" ["D:\\scenes\\rman\\custom\\plugins:@"]`
